# Use of Tuple in Python

#Difference between tuple and List: tuples are immutable but List is mutable,
#Tuple is faster compared to List

myTuple1 = ("Rajesh","Mani","Mehul","Gargi")
myTuple2 = (10,40,20,90,22)
myTuple3 = ("Ektha",33,10.12)
myTuple4 = 100,200,300,400

print(myTuple1)
print(myTuple2)
print(myTuple3)
print(myTuple4)

#Empty Tuple
emptyTuple = ()
print(emptyTuple)
